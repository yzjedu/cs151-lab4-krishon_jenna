This lab presented several challenges that required careful consideration of both the logic and structure of the program. One of the first problems was ensuring that the program handled each package correctly, especially when calculating additional charges for extra data usage. Another challenge was managing the conditional logic for applying the coupon discount, which only applied under certain conditions for the Green package. To address these challenges, I made sure to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, ensuring that the calculations for each package and the data usage were handled separately before integrating the coupon logic. Testing various edge cases, like invalid package names and extreme data usage, helped ensure the program functioned as expected in all scenarios.
I followed the first three rules of programming closely. Instead of rushing or overcomplicating the solution. By focusing on keeping the code straightforward, I avoided unnecessary complexity, which made it easier to debug and maintain. Additionally, I fixed existing Python features like loops and conditional statements rather than trying to build complex structures from scratch. This helped me remain calm and efficient during the coding process.
 I was able to overcome the challenges by breaking the problem down, simplifying where possible, and testing thoroughly. The key takeaway from this lab was the importance of structuring the program in a way that handles various scenarios without becoming overly complex. I also learned the value of testing different inputs to ensure that all parts of the program function correctly, especially with edge cases like invalid inputs or high data usage.
Working with my partner was a positive experience overall. We communicated well and were able to divide the tasks efficiently. My partner contributed by helping refine the logic for calculating the bill, and we discussed the most efficient way to handle invalid inputs. This helped us both learn and complete the lab in a timely manner. I believe I learned what I was supposed to from this lab, particularly in terms of structuring conditional logic and managing edge cases in programming.
