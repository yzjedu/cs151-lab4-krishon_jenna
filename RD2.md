In this lab we were supposed to learn how to collect user inputs, error check the inputs, and use the inputs to make decisions.

Initially, we began working on the test cases and algorithm since those steps are the foundation of the work we had to do.
Nextly, we revised our algorithm and test cases with more feedback on them. After that, we designed and wrote our code making sure to run plenty cases to ensure the integrity of our code. The techniques we used were error-checking using loops, if-else statements, string operations,and mathematical calculations in Python

Our results matched what we expected. Initially, we had trouble figuring out how to design the error-checking loop, but after a quick look at ZYbooks we figured out the solution to the problem.
We tried many test cases for every single pathway to validate the strength of our decision code.

The challenges that we encountered was an issue with how to structure the which loop. Before we designed our algorithm, we had trouble imagining the code without coding a lot of lines of text. We followed the first three rules of coding by being attentive to our algorithm, and making sure it aligned with out code. I liked working with a partner and the process was smooth.
